# Seven Tenets of Indian Nationalism

1. A sovereign and united India is the best hope for the *yogakshema* (happiness, prosperity and well-being) of all its people. 
2. The fundamental goal of the Indian nation is to pursue the betterment of all its people and thus, the betterment of the planet and its future generations. 
3. India is a diverse, plural and inclusive nation, accomodating of aspirations, tolerant of differences, and united in its determination to transcend them. 
4. Indian nationalism is an excellent framework to balance individual rights and collective interests that might sometimes be in opposition.
5. Indian nationalists have always been deeply committed to reforming society towards egalitarianism, equality, equity and justice. 
6. Indian society is anchored in our unifying civilisational moorings as it confidently absorbs and adapts modernity towards the betterment of all its members. 
7. India bears no ill-will to any civilisation, nation-state, faith, religion or ideology but remains absolutely committed to defending its own ethos, values, interests, territory, security and sovereignty. In pursuit of this goal, India will maximise national power in all its forms.
